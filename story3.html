    <h1>Echoes of Ember Hollow</h1>
    <p>
      Long after the fire faded in Ember Hollow, the stories remained. The villagers spoke
      of a mysterious girl who walked through flames unscathed, always appearing when the town needed her most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generations later, her legend still echoed â€” and one curious child decided to find out
      if the flame-walker was real or just a tale whispered on smoky nights.
